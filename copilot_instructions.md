4.  **Compelling Call to Actions (CTAs):**
    *   Ensure each page has clear, strategically placed CTAs that guide the user to the next logical step.
    *   CTAs should be action-oriented and relevant to the page content.

    *   The copy should be informative, engaging, and persuasive.
    *   Clearly articulate the unique power, vision, and benefits of choosing Hyper Lens.
    *   Reflect our position as a leader in futuristic, AI-driven GRC solutions.
